# Sysdig Inspect

Sysdig Inspect is an interactive sysdig trace file analyzer that runs on your Mac or your PC.

The Inspector's user interface is designed to intuitively navigate the data-dense sysdig captures that contain granular system, network and application activity of a Linux system. Sysdig Inspector helps you understand trends, correlate metrics and find the needle in the haystack. It comes packed with features designed to support both performance and security investigations.

To use Sysdig Inspect, you need trace files collected on Linux with [sysdig](https://github.com/draios/sysdig).

# Main Features
## Capture highlights

The overview page offers an out of the box, at a glace summary of the content of the trace file. It includes highlights of resource utilization, file and network activity, security and performance issues and more.

## Sub-second microtrends and metric correlation

## Deep drill down
